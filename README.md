# Intelligent Arduino Robot

This is the source code of our "Rua" robot that can follow line and road signs with just a camera.

[INSERT recap video]

## Installation
- Download the code from this repo (using `git`, or just download the zip)
- Open the file `line_tracker.ino` from your Arduino IDE. It should load the many files (`.ino`, `.h`, `.cpp`) at the same time.

## Development
There are two parts of the code base:
1. Arduino code: `.ino`, `.h.`, `.cpp` files
2. RasPi code: in `ras` folder

## Authors
